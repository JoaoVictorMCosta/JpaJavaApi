Using the POSTMAN (https://www.postman.com/downloads/) u can test that api.

To run it:

1. Just install the maven dependencies; 
2. In your browser, use the localhost:8080 to acess the h2-database;
(If the second step works, u can try with the Postman)
3. Open Postman and make 3 requests(allUsers(GET), singleUser(GET) and saveNewUser(POST));

4. To everyone who tries to use this API, my sincere thanks for supporting this mini personal study project.
